# Things To-Do

- Show which ports are in use for both creating a game and joining a game
- Include a loop that allows user to input in another port if selected port number is invalid, instead of making them start over
- Possibly show the odds are dares themselves with their respective port numbers so that a user can choose the one he/she likes best

## Note:

Unfortunately, we were not able to get to these ideas. On the bright side, they do not cause our program to stop running
