things to refine:
a beter server client connection. we have been having initial struggles
with sending our commands both ways
things to add:
-user input so that server and client may talk to each other
-the functions from board.h that allow that user input to translate
 to a game command 
our stetch goals:
- add cheat codes. If there's time we can 
implement a way to guarantee a hit each time, to peek at the 
opponent's board or bombard the board space to win instantly.
-it seems less likely at this point, but a system that created
 a network seems like it won't happen
