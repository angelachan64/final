How to use:
	 
	 Upon entering your name, a randomly generated board will be
	made for you. If you decde to print it , simply type
	'print board' at anytime to access your board. It will be
	filled with either -1, 0, or 1 for the spaces that represent 
	your ships. -1 is a space with no ship at all. The 0 
	is the place for a ship that hasn't been shot. the 1 represents
	an enemy ship that IS shot. 
	As the user, you need to input the commands '1A, 3B, 4C' , etc,
	to fire a shot and to guess where one of the enemy ships is
