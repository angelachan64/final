known bugs when compiling:
-when writing to a file, we get a lot of the character'@' all over 
the place, almost serving as a space. This needs to be investigated further.
Perhaps it has soemthing to do with the size or type of the buffer 
used in writing?
[MOSTY FIXED]-in background_music.c, there was an incident where the opening
message wont print at the same time that the opening music is played.
The program only runs as long as the song is so must find a way to make it keep looping.
