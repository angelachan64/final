Proposal...
A service where people on different machines can play the 2-player table game "Battleship" 
against one another on the command shell.

design: users should be able to make an account, which gives them access to some file that saves
the win-loss record. One user can only access his/her board, not that of the opponent.
He/she cannot fire a shot until the opponent has fired theirs.

should incorporate:
//piping and server
//shared memory and semaphores
execution of inputs (using fgets to see what a user's shot is)
parsing strings
signals when closing /forfeiting game
using random (when creating a board with ships)
writing to a file
streches: 
cheat codes??
//timer that calls for a forfeit if turn time is up
